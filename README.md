search-marionette
=================

The goal of the application is to practice working with marionette-backbone. I already implemented this functionality using pure Backbone.js. Now i want to implement it using marionette. 

The application itself is a simple search app thats shows its results on a google map panel. Users are able to search STARC collections using keywords, then explore results both on a map or conventionally on a object list. Also they can select locations on the map and explore objects related to the selected place. This app will be the starting point for other applications that will be part of the Starc repository. 

Lets start rolling now and good luck to all.
